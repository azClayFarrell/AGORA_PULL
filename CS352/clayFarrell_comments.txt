I did everything for this project, it took three-ish days.

I did not include Jonah's name in any of the files because he never emailed me
back and didn't even make an effort to expain why, or that he would be leaving
me high and dry.

I have too much to do over the next couple days which is why so many of the
things in this project are so weird, I don't have time to go back for anything
and I was counting on being able to hand it off to someone after I had done
my part on it. UNFORTUNATELY buddy didn't even let me know that was going to
be the case so that I could have prepared for it.

So idk. Just don't give him any kind of points for anything please. I'm sure
there must have been a reason that at the end of the semester with 2 weeks to
go he decided to ditch, but I also think I deserved a response to the email.
This took up so much extra time that I'm behind on the other projects that are
due on Monday as well. So for that, please don't award him anything.
