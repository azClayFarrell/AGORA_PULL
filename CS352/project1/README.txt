INSTRUCTIONS:


To compile type into command line while in the directory that contains both the
struct_sort.c and struct_sort.h files:

    gcc -Wall struct_sort.h

The executable created should be called a.out if you did not rename it, and it
should have been placed in the same directory you ran this command in.

To run the program, type in the same directory that contains a.out:

    ./a.out <input file> <output file>


You should replace where it says input file and output file with the actual
relative path names that you wish to read from and write to.


DESCRIPTION:
    You will enter an input file and an output file when you run the command to
    start this program. The input file will contain peoples contact information. 
    If the input file is formatted properly, the output file will be sorted by
    the persons last name, then the first name if the last name is the same.
    The output will also be comma separated with the spacing adjusted.



POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:

    None from what I can tell.
