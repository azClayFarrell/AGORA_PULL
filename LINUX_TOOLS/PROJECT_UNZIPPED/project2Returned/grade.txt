NOTE:
    Due to the nature of the scripts we are testing, simple errors can lead to multiple tests
    failing. If you believe that is the case. You need to fix the errors and schedule office
    hours and explain the errors in your code. You may earn some of the points back for an single 
    error that caused multiple failures.
